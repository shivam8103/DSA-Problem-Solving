# Problem Statement - Move all zeros to end of array

## Given an array of integers **arr[]**, the task is to **move all the zeros to the end** of the array **while maintaining the relative order** of all non-zero elements.

**Example 1:** 

**Input:** `arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]`

**Output:** `arr[] = [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]`

**Explanation:** There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

**Example 2:** 

**Input:** `arr[] = [10, 20, 30]`

**Output**: `arr[] = [10, 20, 30]`

**Explanation:** No change in array as there are no 0s.

**Example 3:** 

**Input:** `arr[] = [0, 0]`

**Output:** `arr[] = [0, 0]`

**Explanation:** No change in array as there are all 0s.
